# Issues/wish list

* A failed tasks seems to destroy the cache for that task
* We should be able to have more than one cached output per target
* Maybe "task" is not a very good name
* There should be a way to make a build fail early
* vim gets lost when a test raises
* vim sometimes takes a failure to the makefile line, which is not helpful
* We should have a continuous background build
* We should be able to build only a specific target
* Specifying yasf code generation should be easier
